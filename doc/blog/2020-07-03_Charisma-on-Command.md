Jokes in fun, but actions must show you're a nice genuine person.

1. Joke with People You Obviously Like (ie: Friends)
    * If you follow with joke about someone else it's seen in good fun/no ill intent
    * Tease yourself first so friends know it's in fun 
        - too much seems insecure
        - mixed in with jokes of others shows confidence
2. Answer Questions with Absurd (Over the Top) Answers
    * Mix genuine answers with funny answers makes things more fun and not everything said taken at face value

    * Funny without being nice = Jerk
    * Compliments + Teasing = Fun
4. Stereotype without Putting People Down
    * Charactertures/imitiations/impressions ok
    * Don't say anything negative or put down
