## *Where is NorCal*
At this time, most of the world is locked away in the confines of their homes due to Covid-19. The sports and entertainment world has come to a halt; however, ESPN recently released the docuseries "The Last Dance", a memoir of the Michael Jordan era bulls in the 1990s.  This focuses on the final year of the second threepeat and all the events leading up to it with interviews with players and coaches at the time.  Michael Jordan is widely considered the best basketball player of all time and changed the game from center dominated league to a guard/wing driven one. His airness was a travelling spectacle and everyone was a fan. However, all dynasties must come to an end.
