summary: A legacy lives onto the next generation.

At this time, most of the world is locked away in the confines of their homes due to Covid-19. The sports and entertainment world has come to a halt; however, ESPN recently released the docuseries "The Last Dance", a memoir of Michael Jordan era bulls of the 1990s.  This focuses on the final year of the second threepeat and all the events leading up to it with interviews with players and coaches at the time.  Michael Jordan is considered the best basketball player of all time and changed the game from center dominated league to a guard/wing driven one. His airness was a travelling spectacle and everyone was a fan. However all dynasties must come to an end. 

Likewise Stephen Curry changed the game in the 2010s creating the 3pt revelation and leading the way for the efficiency era.  No player in history has ever shot as high a percentage on as high a volume of 3s as Steph Curry. The Warriors dynasty of the 2010s was similar to the Bulls for many of the kids today who never knew Michael Jordan other than a crying meme.  With the departure of Kevin Durant and subsequently Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, and co. is this the same end for the Warriors or a break in the next the next big run?  Injuries have derailed this season, but for the young generation who never knew Jordan, the Warriors and Steph Curry are the next best thing. Hopefully there is still another final run left and beyond.

NorCal Travels (NCT) started a while back, but has been rebooted during these down times and brought back to life via Vuepress. Wordpress and CPanel once owned the internet, but with the advent of NPM and front-end technologies, creating a simple blog has never been easier or cheaper than ever.  With that NCT, will be chronicling life in NorCal from travels, outdoors, food, state of our times, humor, and what it's like to live in one of the greatest places in the world.
