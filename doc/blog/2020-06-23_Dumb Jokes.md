*While volunteering in a soup kitchen, I hit it off with a very attractive single man. It was a relief, since my mother and I always laughed because the men to whom I was drawn were inevitably married. So, optimistic about my chances, I asked my new friend what he did for a living. He replied, “I’m a priest.” Lisa Shasha, Norwich, Connecticut*

STRAPPED FOR CASH <br/>
*During college, I worked on a conveyor belt. One day, I was on a blind date, and she asked me about my job. “I work at the end of a belt,” I said. With an ebullient smile, she asked, “Are you the buckle?” Skip Parker, Reno, Nevada*

BAD THINGS TO TELL YOUR WIFE <br/>
*A commercial boasted that its product could help people live pain-free in their golden years. “Am I in my golden years?” my wife, 63, asked. “Not at all,” I assured her. “But you are yellowing fast.” Dennis McClanahan, Buckner, Missouri*

LYING IN BED <br/>
*I was cuddling with my girlfriend, and she said, “I love lying here with you.” “I once caught a fish, and it was five feet long and spoke Hebrew,” I replied. She stared at me, confused. “That was my lie,” I said. “Oh, right. I see. Very funny,” she said. She paused a moment before rolling over. “That was my lie.” From @ab1kenobe on reddit.com*

DATING A HOARDER <br/>
*I used to date a hoarder, and she broke up with me. That stings extra hard—I’m like the one thing she can get rid of. Sam Morril*

NOTABLE NEVER-ISMS <br/>

* Never board a commercial aircraft if the pilot is wearing a tank top. —Dave Barry

* Never argue with a doctor; he has inside information. —Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding 
* Never keep up with the Joneses. Drag them down to your level; it’s cheaper. —Quentin Crisp

SOCK IT TO ME
*On the first night of their honeymoon, the husband isn’t sure how to tell his bride about his stinky feet and smelly socks, while the wife is wondering how to break the news to him about her awful breath, which so far, she’s been able to cover up. After some soul-searching, the husband gathers his nerve and says, “I have a confession.” She draws closer, peers into his eyes, and says, “Darling, so do I.” Recoiling, he says, “Don’t tell me—you’ve eaten my socks.” Submitted by Justin Ezzi, Wilmington, California*

CONFESSIONS OF A MILITARY WIFE <br/>
* My husband is infantry, and he said the most wonderful things to convince me to marry him: 
* The closets could all be mine since he wears the same thing every day. 
* I could have as many babies as I want because giving birth is free. 
* He would never get on my nerves, because he would always be gone. Mollie Gross (molliegross.com) is the author of Confessions of a Military Wife, published by Savas Beatie.

THIS CLASSIFIED AD SPEAKS VOLUMES: <br/>
*“Wanted to buy: playpen, cradle, high chair; also two single beds.” Matthew Cole, Plant City, Florida*

IT'S A SMALL WORLD… <br/>
*I think the expression “It’s a small world” is really a euphemism for “I keep running into people I can’t stand.” Brock Cohen*

A FAMILIAR PATIENT <br/>
*A weeping woman bursts into her hypnotherapist’s office and declares, “Doctor, I have been faithful to my husband for 15 years, but yesterday I broke that trust and had an affair! The guilt is killing me. I just want to forget that it ever happened!” The hypnotherapist shakes his head. “Not again …” Submitted by Alan lynch, Ithaca, New York*

MY WIFE SAYS I’M UNSOPHISTICATED… <br/>
*My wife says I’m unsophisticated and uncultured, so to prove her wrong, guess where I’m taking her. Hint: It starts with “B” and rhymes with “wallet.” Brad Hamer, on ruminate.com*

FLOWER THERAPY <br/>
*“That’s a nice plant,” said a woman at the florist’s shop, pointing to the flower I was buying. “Yeah, my wife and I had an argument,” I admitted. “I was going to buy her a dozen roses, but I don’t think she’s that mad at me.” Art Flagel, Benton Harbor, Michigan*

GIFT OF THE MAGI? <br/>
*This past Christmas, I told my girlfriend that all I wanted was an Xbox. That’s it. Beginning and end of list: Xbox. You know what she got me? A homemade frame with a picture of us from our first date together. Which was fine. Because I got her an Xbox. Anthony Jeselnik*

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER <br/>
*After waiting two hours for her date, Sarah concluded she’d been stood up. So she changed into pajamas, made some popcorn, and flopped down in front of the TV. Then the doorbell rang—it was her date. He took one look at Sarah and gasped. “You’re still not ready?”*

THE TROUBLE WITH DATING <br/>
*Dating is complicated. You don't believe us? Here are some examples: Right after we broke up, my ex-girlfriend called to ask how to change her relationship status on Facebook. I got into a 90-minute argument with my girlfriend because she was adamant that Moby Dick was a true story. I finally let her win so I could go to sleep. My now ex-girlfriend and I were in my room one day, and the Internet was particularly slow. After I complained, she suggested that I untangle my Ethernet cord so that more Internet could get through. I recently joined an online dating site, and one of my matches was my first cousin.*

FAMILY MATTERS <br/>
*"Why doesn't your mother like me?" a woman asks her boyfriend. "Don't take it personally," he assures her. "She's never liked anyone I've dated. I once dated someone exactly like her, and that didn't work out at all." "What happened?" "My father couldn't stand her."*

CONFERENCE CALL <br/>
*During a conference, I was pleasantly surprised to be seated next to a very handsome man. We flirted casually through dinner, then grew restless as the dignitaries gave speeches. During one particularly long-winded lecture, my new friend drew a # sign on a cocktail napkin. Elated, I wrote down my phone number. Looking startled for a moment, he drew another # sign, this time adding an X to the upper-left-hand corner.*

A BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP <br/>
*I was supposed to go out with this guy on Friday night. On Friday afternoon he called and said that he didn't think it was a good idea, because he just wanted to be friends. So I hung up and called him back. He was like, "Hello?" I said, "Hey, friend, it's me. Want to hear what this jerk just did?"*

DRESS TO IMPRESS <br/>
*My boyfriend and I were taking his 19-year-old niece to a weekend festival. When we arrived at her house to pick her up, she appeared in tasteful but very short shorts, and a tank top with spaghetti straps. A debate began immediately about appropriate dress. I took the girl's side, recalling that when we began dating, I dressed the same way. "Yes," said my boyfriend sternly, "and I said something about it, didn't I?" Everyone looked at me. "Yeah," I replied. "You said, 'What's your phone number?'"*

HAIRY SITUATION <br/>
*I was in line at a restaurant. In front of me was a mother with her college-age son and his girlfriend. It was the middle of the dinner rush, and many customers were restless at the long wait, but the young couple, holding hands and kissing, were oblivious to everything around them. Although clearly not approving, the mother was silent, until one prolonged kiss when the young man had his face and hands buried in his girlfriend's long, curly locks. "Do you have to do that here?" the embarrassed mother asked. "I'm not doing anything, Mom," came her son's muffled voice. "My earring's caught in her hair."*

## Work Jokes
NITPICKER <br/>
*To resolve conflicts between management and staff, I brought both sides together and asked employees to jot down key words on a flip chart. One participant complained about management’s tendency to interfere and wrote the word nitpicking. A manager leaped to his feet to ask, “Shouldn’t there be a hyphen between nit and picking?” —E. Howson, in Reader’s Digest International Edition*

CAN I HOLD YOU? <br/>
*Our booking office had three phones. One day during lunch, I was responsible for answering all of them. It was a constant repeat of “May I help you?” or “Will you hold?” I guess I got confused because I surprised one man on the other end of the line when I answered his call with, “May I hold you?” —Vera Granger*

TAKE THE BLAME <br/>
*The printer was broken, and no one could figure out whose fault it was. After arguing back and forth, our supervisor took charge. “Look,” he said, “we really don’t need to determine who is responsible for this mess. We just want someone to take the blame.”*

SPELLING SASS <br/>
*I’m known as a stickler for good spelling. So when an associate e-mailed technical documents and asked me to “decifer” them, I had to set him straight. “Decipher is spelled with a ph, not an f,” I wrote. “In case you’ve forgotten, spellchecker comes free with your Microsoft program.” A minute later came his reply: “Must be dephective.”*

A MOTIVATED BOSS <br/>
*My boss arrived at work in a brand-new Lamborghini. "Wow," I said. "That's an amazing car." He replied, "If you work hard, put all your hours in, and strive for excellence, I'll get another one next year."*

WHOOPS, CAN’T REMEMBER <br/>

SAD JOB <br/>
*Q: Why did the can crusher quit his job? A: Because it was soda pressing.*

TOUGH COMMUTE <br/>
*Sometimes I feel like there isn’t much difference between my commute to work and the Oregon Trail.*

TEACHER’S AID <br/>
*With the economy improved, my son, Pat, finally found a job in electrical engineering. Pat traveled to various locales to analyze and fix problems with his company’s equipment. Yet it frustrated him that his employer gave him little training.*

*One day Pat heard about some training classes coming up and asked if he might attend. “Oh, sure,” his boss said. “You’re going to be the instructor.”*

*  “The guy asked me to tell him a little about myself, and I literally forgot who I was.”  <br/>
*  “I got asked about punctuality. I went on about how it was good to speak clearly and politely, and it was nice to use proper grammar in speech and writing.” Source: dailymail.co.uk

“BUY YOURSELF SOMETHING NICE, JERK” <br/>
*My friend, an intern, was given $50 to get the chairman of the bank some lunch. Told to get himself something, he bought a shirt. Source: storify.com*

THE REAL MEANING OF “AN APPLE A DAY”… <br/>
*My wife, a phlebotomist at the Denver VA hospital, entered a patient’s room to draw blood. Noticing an apple on his nightstand, she remarked, “An apple a day keeps the doctor away, right?” “That’s true,” he agreed. “I haven’t seen a doctor in three days.” Larry Jensen, Englewood, Colorado*

ENGLISH IS HARD <br/>
*My colleague has been living in this country only a few months, and although normally chipper, he recently looked sad. When I asked what was wrong, he responded glumly, “Today, everything wrong is going in my favor.” Bacchus Johnson, Charlotte, North Carolina*

WHAT NOT TO SAY IN A JOB INTERVIEW <br/>
*My boss and I took a job applicant to lunch, where we tried, with little success, to get him to open up about his experience and qualifications. Frustrated, my boss set his salad aside and proposed a specific and complex situation to the young man, then asked, “What would you do?” The applicant hesitated, then, looking my boss straight in the eye, said, “Are you going to eat all those tomatoes?” John Richman, Webster, New York*

ART REFLECTS LIFE… TOO CLOSELY <br/>
*As a Speech therapist, I was working with a preschooler on body-part identification and the k sound. To that end, I had him use Play-Doh to make a sculpture of me. “Is that my neck?” I asked, trying to get him to repeat the word. “No, that’s your chin,” he said. He added more Play-Doh. “Is that my neck?” I asked. “No, that’s your other chin.” Ilene Smith, Milan, Michigan*

TIME ZONES ARE HARD. <br/>
*While I was out to lunch, my coworker answered my phone and told the caller that I would be back in 20 minutes. The woman asked, “Is that 20 minutes Central Standard Time?”  Jamie Hindman, Lewisville, Texas*

INSULT OR COMPLIMENT? <br/>
*Have You Ever Been Insulted And Complimented At The Same Time? It’s amazing how a person can compliment and insult you at the same time. Recently, when I greeted my coworker, she said, “You look so gorgeous, I didn’t recognize you.” Elaine Schyve, Cohocton, New York*

A BUSINESSMAN ON PERFECTION… <br/>

DESIGN CLIENT FROM HELL: “REMOVE THAT CIRCLE” <br/>
*Client: Please remove the unnecessary circle at the end of the sentence. Me: You mean … the period? Client: I don’t care what you designers call it; it is unsightly. Delete it. Source: clientsfromhell.net*

MY KIDS DON’T KNOW WHAT I DO <br/>
*I’ve been working on my PhD in engineering for the past five years, but my kids don’t necessarily see that as work. As we were driving past Walmart one day, my son spotted a Now Hiring sign and suggested that I could get a job there. Hoping to make a point, I asked, “Do you think they’re looking for an engineer?” “Oh, sure,” he said. “They’ll hire anybody.” Christopher Fields, Fort Collins, Colorado*

AN IMPOSSIBLY LONG LEAVE <br/>
*An insurance agent called our medical office. One of our doctors had filled out a medically necessary leave-of-absence form for a patient, but, the agent said, the patient had altered it. The giveaway? The return-to-work date had been changed to February 30. J. L., via e-mail*

THE WRONG LESSON <br/>
*I supervised an employee who had a negative view of everything I did. If I took a vacation day, I was “never there.” If I praised someone’s work, it was “too little, too late.” He eventually took another job but was fired six months later. Shortly thereafter, he contacted me, hoping to return to his old job. “Have you learned anything from this experience?” I asked. “Yes, I should have stayed here,” he admitted. “You’re too indecisive to have ever fired me.” Terry O’Connor, Chantilly, Virginia*

MARRIED TO THE JOB <br/>
*I guess this is what happens after you’ve worked at the same place for a while. I was eating at a fast-food restaurant when an employee began his shift by walking into the kitchen area and calling out, “Honey, I’m home!” G. M., via e-mail*

WEIRD QUESTIONS LIBRARIANS HEAR… <br/>
*Before google, there were librarians. Here are some queries posed to the poor, suffering staff of public libraries:* <br/>
*  A woman wanted “inspirational material on grass and lawns.”  <br/>
*  “Who built the English Channel?”  <br/>
*  “Is there a full moon every night in Acapulco?”  <br/>
*  “Music suitable for a doll wedding to take place between a Shirley Temple doll and a teddy bear.”  <br/>

*The flight attendant on our trip was handing out plastic pilot wings to some kids. As I stepped forward, she jokingly offered me one, but I passed. Pointing to the Airborne wings on my Army uniform, I explained, “The last time someone gave me wings, I had to jump out of the airplane.” Col. David Jessop (Ret.), Rineyville, Kentucky*

DRUMMING UP A REASON <br/>
*A man vacations on a tropical island, and the first thing he hears is drums. He goes to the beach and hears the drums; he eats lunch, he hears the drums; he tries to sleep, he can’t—drums. Finally he storms over to the manager. “I’ve had it! Can’t you stop those drums?” he begs. “No!” says the manager. “It’s very bad if the drums stop.” “Why?” “When the drums stop, the bass solo begins.”*

ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON <br/>
*A tramp knocks on the door of an inn known as St. George and the Dragon. The landlady answers. "Could you give a poor man something to eat?" asks the tramp. "No!" yells the woman, slamming the door in his face. A few minutes later, he knocks again. "Now what do you want?" the woman asks. "Could I have a few words with George?"*

COMIC CONDUCTOR <br/>
*Halfway between New York City and Washington, D.C., the train's engine fell silent. "I've got good news and bad news," the conductor announced. "The bad news is we lost power." My fellow passengers groaned. "The good news," he added, "is we weren't cruising at 30,000 feet."*

PERFECT TIMING <br/>
*On vacation in Hawaii, my step- mom, Sandy, called a café to make reservations for 7 p.m. Checking her book, the cheery young hostess said, "I'm sorry, all we have is 6:45. Would you like that?"* <br/>
"That's fine," Sandy said. <br/>
"Okay," the woman confirmed. Then she added, "Just be advised you may have to wait 15 minutes for your table."

AIRPLANE CONFUSION <br/>
*My flight was delayed in Houston. Since the gate was needed for another flight, our aircraft was backed away from the terminal, and we were directed to a new gate. We all found the new gate, only to discover a third gate had been designated for our plane. Finally, everyone got on board the right plane, and the flight attendant announced: "We apologize for the gate change. This flight is going to Washington, D.C. If your destination is not Washington, D.C., you should deplane at this time." A moment later a red-faced pilot emerged from the cockpit, carrying his bags. "Sorry," he said, "wrong plane."*

WIN-WIN <br/>
*I couldn't decide whether to go to Salt Lake City or Denver for vacation, so I called the airlines to get prices. "Airfare to Denver is $300," the cheery salesperson replied. "And what about Salt Lake City?" "We have a really great rate to Salt Lake—$99," she said "But there is a stopover." "Where?" "In Denver," she said.*

## Weather Jokes
SOUTH TO VERMONT <br/>
*On a fishing trip to a remote lake in Northern Quebec, I asked the outfitter, “Do you stay here during the winter?” “No,” he said. “The snow gets too deep. We can’t get supplies in. Like many Canadians, I go south for the winter.” “Oh,” I said. “Where do you go?” “Vermont.”*

17 WARM-WEATHER JOKES FOR SUMMER <br/>
1. Past Lives On a family vacation one summer, we crossed Wyoming and noted several historical points of interest. The children were especially interested because they enjoyed the computer game "Oregon Trail," which gives players a taste of the hardships the pioneers endured. We stopped at the famous South Pass to look at the wagon tracks still visible in the dirt. Squinting out over the desolate, wind-swept landscape, my daughter nodded and said grimly, "This is where my oxen always die." -- Quin Gilbert <br/>
2. Mr. Summertime We all grew up in a town on the New Jersey shore and spent our summers at the beach, swimming, surfing, hanging out with friends. One of my friends loved the season so much, we began calling him Mr. Summertime. "What happens when summer is over?" someone asked. I thought for a minute, then said, "In September he becomes the Fall Guy." -- J. Cummings <br/>
3. Wishful Thinking My two-year-old cousin scared us one summer by disappearing during our lakeside vacation. More than a dozen relatives searched the forest and shoreline, and everyone was relieved when we found Matthew playing calmly in the woods. "Listen to me, Matthew," his mother said sharply. "From now on when you want to go someplace, you tell Mommy first, okay?" Matthew thought about that for a moment and said, "Okay. Disney World." -- Leah Hallenbeck <br/>
4. Moving Forward The summer after college graduation, I was living at home, fishing in the daytime, spending nights with my friends—generally just hanging out. One afternoon my grandfather, who never went to college, stopped by. Concerned with how I was spending my time, he asked about my future plans. I told him I was in no hurry to tie myself down to a career. "Well," he replied, "you better start thinking about it. You'll be thirty before you know it." "But I'm closer to twenty than to thirty," I protested. "I won't be thirty for eight more years." "I see," he said, smiling. "And when will you be twenty again?" -- Marshall K. Essig <br/>
5. Sounding Off I was with a friend in a café when a noisy car alarm interrupted our conversation. "What good are car alarms when no one pays any attention to them?" I wondered aloud. "Some are quite effective," my friend corrected me. "Last summer, my teenager spent a lot of time at the neighbors'. Whenever I wanted him home, I'd go out to our driveway and jostle his car." -- Sheila Moore <br/>
6. A Perfect Fit For her summer job, my 18-year-old daughter arranged interviews at several day-care centers. At one meeting, she sat down on one of the kiddie seats, no simple task for most people. The interview went well, and at the end, the day-care center director asked the standard question, "Can you give me one good reason we should hire you?" "Because I fit in the chairs." She got the job. -- Judith L. McKay <br/>
7. Tag Sale Special I was getting ready for a tag sale one summer day. Since it was so humid out, I decided to stay inside my air-conditioned house and mark the special stickers I had bought for the sale. Then I slapped them on my blouse, ran outside, stuck them on the appropriate items and rushed back inside. I did this until every item was labeled. Later that day a UPS man came by the house with a delivery. I noticed that as I was signing for the package, he seemed ill at ease. It was only after he left that I noticed there was one sticker still attached to the front of my blouse. It read "Make me an offer." -- Mary E. Koppelmann <br/>
8. Clowning Around Before heading on vacation, I went to a tanning salon. I was under the lights so long the protective eye shades I wore left a big white circle around each eye. Gazing at myself in the mirror the next day, I thought, "Man, I look like a clown." I had almost convinced myself I was overreacting -- until I was in line at the grocery store. I felt a tug at my shirt and looked down to see a toddler staring up at me, "Are you giving out balloons?" he asked. -- Nina Secviar, Hammond, Ind. <br/>
9. Hotter Cooler On a recent vacation at a resort with my in-laws, we planned to spend an afternoon at the pool with our kids. We wanted to bring our own drinks, but were unsure of the hotel's policy. My brother-in-law called the front desk, and assuming everyone was familiar with the brand of ice chest he had, asked if it was all right if he brought a Playmate to the pool. After a pause the clerk asked, "Does she have her own towel?" -- Tina M. Digiovanna <br/>
10. Forcast Vacationing in Vermont, I picked up the local paper to check out the forecast. It read: Today: Sunny, 76. Tonight: Not so sunny, 55. -- Norrine Trono <br/>
11. Beach Date Our first day at a resort my wife and I decided to hit the beach. When I went back to our room to get something to drink, one of the hotel maids was making our bed. I grabbed my cooler and was on my way out when I paused and asked, "Can we drink beer on the beach?" "Sure," she said, "but I have to finish the rest of the rooms first." -- Louis Allard <br/>
12. Familiar Faces Vacationing in Hawaii, two priests decide to wear casual clothes so they won't be identified as clergy. They buy Hawaiian shirts and sandals, and soon hit the beach. They notice a gorgeous blonde in a tiny bikini. "Good afternoon, Fathers," she says as she strolls by. The men are stunned. How does she know they're clergy? Later they buy even wilder attire: surfer shorts, tie-dyed T-shirts, and dark glasses. The next day, they return to the beach. The same fabulous blonde, now wearing a string bikini, passes by, nods politely at them, and says, "Good morning, Fathers." "Just a minute, young lady," says one of the priests. "We are priests and proud of it, but how in the world did you know?" "Don't you recognize me? I'm Sister Kathryn from the convent." -- Michael Rana <br/>
13. Noisy by Nature Some people just aren't happy unless they have something to complain about. I stayed in a beautiful hotel right on the beach in California -- an idyllic spot, you would think. But while I was waiting to check out, I heard the manager ask another guest, "Did you enjoy your stay?" "Not really," the man said grimly. "I'm sorry to hear that," the manager apologized. "What was the problem?" "The surf was too loud." -- Daniel Vargas <br/>
14. Something's Fishy While in the men's room at a beach park in Florida, I noticed they had a plastic baby-changing table installed on the wall. Apparently, some sportsmen had co-opted this politically correct amenity for their own use. Above the table was a sign saying: "It is unlawful to clean fish on this table." -- Cliff Revell <br/>
15. Out of Breath While editing announcements for a newspaper, I came across an item promoting a camp for children with asthma. Aside from all the wonderful activities the kids could enjoy, such as canoeing, swimming, crafts and more, it promised that its lakefront property offered something the kids probably did not expect: "breathtaking views." -- Christy Nichols <br/>
16. Young Man Visiting his parents' retirement village in Florida, my middle-aged friend, Tim, went for a swim in the community pool while his elderly father took a walk. Tim struck up a conversation with the only other person in the pool, a five-year-old boy. After a while, Tim's father returned from his walk and called out, "I'm ready to leave." Tim then turned to his new friend and announced that he had to leave because his father was calling. Astonished, the wide-eyed little boy cried, "You're a kid?" -- Janice Palko <br/>
17. Last Swimmer I was talking on the phone with my son, who was stationed in Hawaii with the Air Force. He was explaining how the troops were learning to scuba-dive. They used the buddy system, he said, and occasionally dived into shark-infested waters. Listening on the extension, my daughter asked, "What do you do when you see a shark?" Said my son, "Swim faster than my buddy." -- Joan Nozkowski

CLIMATE CHANGE <br/>
*According to a news story, if global warming continues, in 20 years the only chance we'll have to see a polar bear is in a zoo. So in other words, nothing is going to change.*

OUT OF IT <br/>
*When I overheard one of my cashiers tell a customer, "We haven't had it for a while, and I doubt we'll be getting it soon," I quickly assured the customer that we would have whatever it was she wanted by next week. After she left, I read the cashier the riot act.*

*"Never tell the customer that we're out of anything. Tell them we'll have it next week," I instructed her. "Now, what did she want?"*

*"Rain."*

OTHER EMERGENCY <br/>
*Our family took shelter in the basement after hearing a tornado warning. My husband told everyone to stay put while he got his cell phone out of the car, in case the lines went dead.*

*He didn't return for the longest time, so I went looking for him. I was upstairs calling his name, when I heard our phone machine click on.*

*"Hi," a voice said. "This is Dad. I'm locked out of the house."*

WORKING 9 TO 5? <br/>
*Because my wife and I are flea market dealers, we usually carry stacks of $1 bills. Not long ago, we had lunch at a restaurant and paid the check with singles. As our waitress collected the ones, she sized up my 70-year-old wife and said, "You had a good night dancing last night, huh?"*

PIECE OF THE PIE <br/>

*"I know what to do," the man said. "I'll cover it up."And with that, he slapped a sticker over the price that read "$2.98 Day Old."*

*A last-minute filer walked into our state income tax office and handed me his returns. Just as he did, a peal of laughter could be heard in another room. Glaring at me, he grumbled, “What are they doing back there, counting the money?” William Umberson, San Diego, California*

MONEY TROUBLES <br/>
*I was in small-claims court when I listened in on the case of a woman who held a good job but still had trouble paying her bills on time. "Can't you live within your income?" asked the judge. "No, Your Honor," she said. "It's all I can do to live within my credit."*

CHECK PLEASE! <br/>
*My friend has a bad habit of overdrawing her bank account. One day before we went shopping, I complained about my lack of funds and lamented, “Guess I’ll use plastic.” Unconcerned, she whipped out her checkbook: “I’m using rubber.”*

RENTERS' EXCUSES <br/>
*No one likes coughing up rent. But at least these tenants gave landlords creative reasons for avoiding it.*

*"With my daughter's graduation, our new boat, and our trip to Europe this year, we're a little strapped."*

*"We're a little short right now. But don't worry—we're getting a refund on my wife's tattoo. The artist messed it up, and we're getting back most of the bucks!"*

*"I didn't pay the rent because I'm saving up to move."*

*"It's your fault the check bounced. Why didn't you tell me you were going to run to the bank the very same day!"*

A CHARITY CASE <br/>
*A local charity had never received a donation from the town's banker, so the director made a phone call. "Our records show you make $500,000 a year, yet you haven't given a penny to charity," the director began. "Wouldn't you like to help the community?" The banker replied, "Did your research show that my mother is ill, with extremely expensive medical bills?" "Um, no," mumbled the director. "Or that my brother is blind and unemployed? Or that my sister's husband died, leaving her broke with four kids?" "I … I … I had no idea." "So," said the banker, "if I don't give them any money, why would I give any to you?"*

LOST AND FOUND <br/>
*The teenager lost a contact lens while playing basketball in his driveway. After a brief, fruitless search, he gave up. His mother took up the cause and within minutes found the lens.*

*"How did you do that?" he asked.*

*"We weren’t looking for the same thing," she explained. "You were looking for a small piece of plastic. I was looking for $150."*


TAXING NOTICES <br/>
*To publicize colon cancer screenings, an Idaho doctor suggested that a reminder be included in every tax notice. The idea was nixed. "Recommending a colonoscopy in the same envelope as the tax notice may be considered ironic," said the county treasurer.*

A FRIENDLY SALE <br/>
*I took four tires to a friend’s garage sale and was asking $30 apiece. I needed to leave for a few minutes, so I asked him to watch them for me.*

*"Sure," he said, "but if someone offers less, how low are you willing to go?"*

*"Try for more, but I will accept $15," I said, and left.*

*When I returned, my tires were gone. "How much did you get for them?" I asked excitedly.*

DRESSING THE PART <br/>
*Before my son could start going on job interviews, he needed to dress the part. That, he decided, required a $500 suit.*

*"What!?" I answered, gagging at the price tag. "I've bought cars for $500!"*

*"That's why I want the $500 suit," he said. "So I don't have to drive $500 cars."*

IT'S ALL IN A NAME <br/>
*If your name is on the building, you're rich; if your name is on your desk, you're middle-class; if your name is on your shirt, you're poor.*

WORK AND LIFE <br/>
*I received a letter saying I would not be given the American Express credit card I'd requested because my income wasn't substantial enough. Oddly enough, I work for American Express.*

IN THE FREEZER <br/>
*My husband is—how should I put this—cheap, once going so far as to reuse the freezer bags our grown daughter Molly left behind after a visit. Needless to say, it gave me a start when, looking through the freezer, I found packages labeled steak, chicken breast, and Molly.*


CAR WARS <br/>
*A guy in a Kia pulls up next to a Rolls-Royce at a red light and asks, "Hey, is your car Bluetooth enabled?" The Rolls owner nods.*

*"So is mine. Got Wi-Fi?" The Rolls owner nods again.*

*"Me too. What about a double bed?"*

*"No. Do you?" asks the Rolls guy.*

*"Yep."*

*The Kia owner peers out. "You got me out of the shower to tell me that?!"*

AIRLINE FEES <br/>
*With airlines adding fees to fees, The Week magazine asked its readers to predict the next surcharge they'll levy for something previously free.*

*4. $9 fee for bumping your head on the overhead bin as you take your seat; $3 additional penalty for looking up at the bin after you bump into it.*


MIND OFF THE RACETRACK <br/>
*To get his mind off his losing streak at the racetrack, I took my friend horseback riding. Being a novice, he freaked when his mount took off.*

*"How do I stop?" he yelled.*

*"Bet on it!" I hollered back.*

GOOD PARENTING <br/>
*If you are truly serious about preparing your child for the future, don't teach him to subtract—teach him to deduct.*

ASKING FOR HELP <br/>
*A devastated-looking man knocks on the door of a woman known for her charity.*

*"Please, ma'am," he says when she opens up, "can you help this poor, tragic family down the block? The father just lost his job, and his wife is too ill to work. They're about to be turned out into the cold streets unless someone can pay their rent."*

*"That's the worst thing I've ever heard in my life!" says the woman. "May I ask who you are?"*

*"Their landlord."*

CASHIER <br/>
*Driving back from Vermont, I stopped at a vegetable stand. It was deserted except for a sleeping German shepherd. I stepped over the dog, helped myself to some corn, then opened the cashbox to pay. Taped to the inside of the lid was this note: "The dog can count."*


FRUGALITY NOW <br/>
*A millionaire, a hard hat, and a drunk are at a bar. When they get their beers, they notice a fly in each mug. The millionaire politely asks the bartender for another beer, then proceeds to sip it. The hard hat spills out just enough to get rid of the fly and quaffs the rest. It's now the drunk's turn. He sticks his hand into the beer, grabs the fly by the wings, and shouts, "Spit it out! Spit it out!"*

GAMBLING <br/>
*When he blew a wad of money at my blackjack table in the casino, a customer stood up and yelled, "How do you lose $200 at a $2 table?!" Before I could speak, another customer replied, "Patience."*

CULTURAL SHOCK <br/>
*During a visit to our friend's home in Canada, we were feted with a wonderful breakfast. But my six-year-old daughter was not impressed.*

*"Your pancakes are smaller than my mom's," she told him.*

*He replied, "That's because of the exchange rate."*

PAYING UP <br/>
*One day at a local café, a woman suddenly called out, "My daughter’s choking! She swallowed a nickel! Please, anyone, help!"*

*Immediately a man at a nearby table rushed up to her and said he was experienced in these situations. He calmly stepped over to the girl, then with no look of concern, wrapped his arms around her and squeezed. Out popped the nickel.*

*The man returned to his table as if nothing had happened.*

*"Thank you!" the mother cried. "Tell me, are you a doctor?"*

*"No," the man replied. "I work for the IRS."*

BY THE NUMBERS <br/>
*We were eating at one of the trendier restaurants in town when my friend pointed to the menu and told the waitress, "I'll have the 24."*

*"Uh, Jim," I whispered, "that's the price, not the meal number."*

*"Oh," he said. "Then give me the 12."*

ODD GIFT <br/>
*I’ve never understood the concept of the gift certificate, because for the same 50 bucks, my friend could’ve gotten me 50 bucks.*

GREAT WRITER <br/>
*Visiting a college campus, the prospective student spots a building called Hemingway Hall. "That's nice," he says, "a building named for Ernest Hemingway."*

*"Actually," says the tour guide, "it's named for Joshua Hemingway."*

*"Was he a writer?" the student asks.*

*"Yes. He wrote a big check."*

SOME CHANGE <br/>
*After cashing a check at the bank, the woman in front of me stood staring at her money. "Did I give you enough back?" asked the teller. "Yes," she said. "But barely."*

THE SECRET TO SUCCESS <br/>
*The pastor decides to use one rich parishioner to set an example. "John," he says, "you're a successful businessman; surely you could contribute more to the building fund."*

*John replies, "But my mother is in a nursing home, my daughter just lost her job, and my son is starting college … If I can say no to them, I can say no to you too."*

TAKING IT WITH YOU <br/>
*Lying on his deathbed, the rich, miserly old man calls to his long-suffering wife. "I want to take all my money with me," he tells her. "So promise me you'll put it in the casket."*

*After the man dies, his widow attends the memorial service with her best friend. Just before the undertaker closes the coffin, she places a small metal box inside.*

*Her friend looks at her in horror. "Surely," she says, "you didn't put the money in there."*

*"I did promise him I would," the widow answers. "So I got it all together, deposited every penny in my account, and wrote him a check. If he can cash it, he can spend it."*

CASH WHO? <br/>
*Knock! Knock!* <br/>
Who's there? <br/>
Cash. <br/>
Cash who? <br/>
I didn't realize you were some kind of nut!

ROBIN WHO? <br/>
Knock! Knock! <br/>
Who's there? <br/>
Robin. <br/>
Robin who? <br/>
Robin' you! So hand over your money!

DELIVERING SOME NOTICE <br/>
*Freelance newspaper writers don't get nearly as much attention as writers with regular bylines. So I was delighted when I finally got some notice. It was at the bank, and I was depositing a stack of checks.*

*"Wow," said the teller, reading off the names of publishers from the tops of the checks. "You must deliver a lot of papers."*

FAULTY SAFE <br/>
*On a billboard ad for a safe company:*

*"If your stuff is stolen, it's not our vault."*

TOO MUCH MONEY <br/>
*My husband, an attorney, is frequently consulted by clients who, after learning what the cost of legal services will be, decide to do without his aid. Recently the elderly minister of a small, struggling church came in with a legal problem.*

*After patiently listening to an explanation of my husband's fees, he left the office with a prudent: "Thank you, sir, but I believe I'll just pray this one through."*


GUILTY TAX PAYER <br/>
*Dear IRS: I'm sending you this money because I cheated on my income tax and my conscience has been bothering me. If it doesn't stop, I'll send you the rest.*

PENNILESS <br/>
*I requested identification from a department-store customer who had just written a personal check for her purchase. After fumbling through her purse, she presented me with what she said was the only thing that bore both her name and address.*

*It was a notice of insufficient funds from her bank.*
