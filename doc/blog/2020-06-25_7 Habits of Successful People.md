## Character Ethic (Enduring Principles)
* Fairness
    - The foundation of Justice
* Honest and Integrity
    - What Trust is built upon
* Service
    - Making a contribution/giving back
* Quality
    - Striving for Excellence and Improvement

## Personality Ethic

* Attitudes and Behaviors
  - Positive and Mental Attitude (PMA)
* Skills and Techniques

## 4 Life Support Factors
1. Security
    - sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, your basic personal strength or lack of it
2. Guidance
    - your source of direction in life
3. Wisdom
    - your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various
parts and principles apply and relate to each other
4. Power
    - faculty or capacity to act, the strength and potency to accomplish something

## Fulfillment in Life
* Serve
* Produce
* Contribute in meaningful ways
* learning/growing

## There are times to teach and not teach
* When relationships are strained and emotional, teaching may be perceived as judgment and rejection

* Teach when alone, quiet, and the relationship is good 

* Intimidation (fear) builds weakness. Depends on external factors to get things done. When fear replaces cooperation, both people become illogical and defensive.

## Things we blame
* Genetics
* Psychic - upbringing
* Environment - people and situations that surround you

## Management vs Leadership
* Producers and Problem Solvers (Employees) - cutting through jungle with manchettes
* Managers - behind employees, writing policy/procedure, sharpening the knives, set up schedules, compensation programs for employees
* Leader - climbs the tallest tree, surveys the situation, yells "Wrong Jungle!". 
    - The busy, efficient, employees and managers respond "shut up, we're making progress!"

## Habit 1: Proactive
### Application Actions
1. Listen to your language and others around you for __reactive language__
    - "If only"
    - "I can't"
    - "I have to"
2. Find an Example and how you would respond __proactively__
    - behave reactively in the past
    - remind yourself of gap between stimulus and response
    - make a commitment to yourself that you have the freedom to choose your response
3. Pick a problem at work/personal life
    - determine whether the problem ("control") is:
        * Direct - your behavior
        * Indirect - other people's behavior
        * No control - we can do nothing about
    - ID the first step in control of influence then take that step
4. 30 Day Test
    - be __proactive__ for 30 days
        * how we handle situations
            - how we view the problem
            - where we focus our energy
            - language we use/put out there
        * make small commitments and keep them
        * be a light not a judge
        * be a model not a critic
        * be part of the solution not the problem
        * don't argue for other people's weaknesses or your own
        * when you make a mistake: admit it, correct it, learn from it immediately
            - don't blame or accuse
        * work on yourself, things you can control
        * look at weaknesses of others with compassion, not accusation
            - issue isn't what they are doing/not doing
            - issue is your response to the situation and what you should be doing
            - if you think the problem is "out there", that thought is the problem
        * we are __Responsible__ for our own effectiveness, happiness, our own circumstances
            - don't act out the scripts written by parents, associates, and society
    - note the change in your circle of influence

## Habit 2: End in Mind
* Imagine being on deathbed, how do you want to be remembered? Work backwards
* Develop a mission statement
    - personal mission statement based on values
    - organizational mission statements must involve everyone to develop
### Mental (1st) Creation
* Imagination:
    - Envision - create in our minds what can't see presently
    - See Potential
    - Conscience - ID our own personal endowments
### 4 Human Endowments
1. **Self-Awareness**
2. Imagination
3. Conscience
4. Independent Will - Act not acted upon

## Habit 3: First thing First
### Physical (2nd) Creation
* Fulfillment, actualization, natural emergence of Habits 1 & 2
* Practicing Self Management: Day-in, day-out; moment-by-moment doing it
    - Manage from Left Brain (Logic)
    - Lead from Right Brain (Art)

### Self Management
|                    | Urgent      | Not Urgent      |
| ------------------ |:-----------:| :--------------:|
| **Important**      | Necessity   |<u>**Effectiveness**</u>|
| **Not Important**  | Distraction |   Waste         |

#### Waste
* Trivial Work
* Avoidance Activities

* Internet Browsing
* Time-Wasters
* Gossip

### Being Effective
Effectiveness focus is a paradigm that grows out of a principle center
- if centered on spouse, money, friends, pleasure, extrinsic or self then will thrown into Necessities and Distractions. Will react to outside forces or impulses
- be principle centered/personal mission/bigger picture (character ethics). Need self-discipline and motivation to avoid distractions and time wasters

#### Weekly Planning
1. ID your roles for the week (ie: worker, personal/individual, parent, spouse)
2. Select goals for the week
3. Scheduling - make time during the week to work towards achieving goals for the week
4. Daily Adapting - Things happen and need to review schedule every day to still achieve goals

### Delegation
1. Gofer (Micromanage)
    * "Go/do for this, go/do for that. Tell me when it's done"
    * Too focused on methods and feel responsible for results
        - the person receiving the task may not feel responsible
    * Most employees/producers still think like that once promoted
2. **Stewardship Delegation**
    * Focused on results instead of methods
    * Clear, up-front, mutual understanding, and commitment in expectations in 5 areas
        1. Desired Results
        2. Guidelines
            - few as possible, but include any restrictions
                * if don't give enough info and they violate rule unbeknownst, kills initiative and instills "just tell me what to do, and I'll do it" 
            - be honest and open
                * if you know failure paths, let them know upfront
                    - tell them what not to do, not how they should do it
                    - ok to give recommendation on how I'd do it
        3. Resources
            - ID human, financial, technical, or organizational resources they may want to use
        4. Accountability
            - set up performance standards for evaluating results (what's it for? why do this?) and due dates
        5. Consequences
            - Good and bad as a result of the evaluation
                * rewards, new job assignments, natural consequences
    * Gives people a choice of methods and responsible for results
    * Takes more initial time investment, but can increase your time leverage via effective Stewardship Delegation
    * Stewardship = job with trust
        - I trust you to do the job, to get it done. You're the boss of yourself now.
        - boss becomes the helper. may only have limited time, but employee tells boss how they can help
        - employee becomes the judge: 
            * regular check-ins with the boss. Employee tells boss how it's coming along
    * Trust is highest form of human motivation
        - takes time + patience + training/development (increase competency)
        - objective: empower the employee
    * More work gets done in less time in the future
    * Must want to manage, not just produce 
    * Focus on effectiveness not efficiency
    * With immature employees - fewer results, more guidelines/resources/check-ins/immediate consequences
    * With mature employees - more challenging results, less guidelines/check-ins
    * Effective delegation is best indicator of effective management: basis of personal/organizational growth

## Paradigms of Interdependence
* Must master self independence/discipline first
    - **you can't talk your way out of problems you behave yourself into**
    - most important part we put into any relationship is not our actions/words, but what we are
        * if words/actions come from superficial HR techniques (personality ethic) others will sense deception
        * can't be trusted
* golden eggs = effectiveness: the results from open communication, positive interaction w/others
* goose = relationships: must create and maintain

### Emotional Bank Account
* the amount of trust that's been built in a relationship
    - feeling of safeness with someone
* Make deposit into EBA through kindness, courtesy, honesty, and keeping commitments to someone
    - trust towards them increases
    - can use that trust if make mistakes in future, reserves compensate
    - must keep making deposits to maintain relationship
* when trust in EBA is high, communication is easy, instant, and effective
* Reduce trust in EBA:
    - showing discourtesy, disrespect
    - cutting them off
    - overreacting
    - ignoring
    - becoming arbitrary
    - betraying trust
    - threatening
    - playing god in your life
* Once trust in EBA low, have to be careful with every word/interaction/PYA
    - you may get tuned out
* When relationship deteriorates:
    - accommodation, 2 ppl live independent lifestyles and tolerate the other
    - hostility, defensiveness, verbal fights, emotional withdrawal, self-pity, cold war, legal battles
* Most constant relationships (ie: marriage) require most constant deposits
    - with continuous expectations, old deposits are lost
    - sometimes automatic EBA withdraws in daily interactions (ie: nagging)

### 6 Major Deposits
1. Understanding the Individual
    * What might be a deposit for you might not be for someone else. May be a withdrawal
    * To make a deposit: What is important to them must be as important to you as the other person is to you
        - what you may find unimportant may be very important to another person (ie: child)
        - stop projecting our autobiographies: interpret what a deposit is based on our needs/desires now or at a similar age/stage in life
        - understand others a you would like to be understood and do that
2. Attending to the Little Things
    * small discourtesies/unkindness/disrespect = large withdrawals
    * little things are the big things in relationships people remember most
3. Keeping Commitments
    * keeping a promise = major deposit
    * breaking one = MAJOR (biggest) withdrawal
    * don't make a promise you can't keep
        - make them very carefully/sparingly
        - be aware of variables/contingencies that may stop from fulfilling
        - be true to your word
4. Clarifying Expectations
    * unclear expectations in goals undermine communication and trust
        - leads to misunderstandings and large withdrawals
    * many times implicit (ie: marriage) and are based on assumed roles
    * get all expectations in a new situation. will be judged on those later
        - clarifying expectations takes a lot of courage and problems should be brought to the table and worked out
5. Show Personal Integrity
    * generates trust and is the basis of deposits
    * lack of integrity undermine all other efforts to create trust
    * be honest, keep promises, and fulfill expectations
        - be loyal to those not present. 
            * if you agree with gossip/criticism, suggest approaching non-present person together
                - builds trust even if honest confrontation not initially appreciated
                - you care enough to confront
            * may seem like a deposit, but a withdrawal. shows you can't be trusted
    * to be trusted > being loved
    * be patient with everyone - people will test your patience, so don't overreact
    * avoid deceptive communication, guile, lack dignity
    * apologize **sincerely** when we make a withdrawal (becomes a deposit):
        - I was wrong
        - That was unkind of me
        - I showed you no respect
        - I embarrassed you in front of everyone, it was uncalled for.
    * repeated apologies are **insincere** = withdrawal
    * mistakes of mind or heart (bad intentions/motives/cover ups/justifications)
        - people will forgive mistakes in lapse of judgement (mind) not theI heart
6. Laws of Love and Life
    * unconditional love deposits -> let's others be themselves
        - not permissive/soft/pushover (withdrawal)
        - counsel, plead, set limits/boundaries
    * if attach strings then others become reactive/defensive
        - rebellion from heart not mind
        - make constant deposits of unconditional love
    * "It's more noble to give yourself completely to 1 individual than to labor diligently for the salvation of the masses"
        - most important to have strong relationships with those closest to you

### P Problems = PC Opportunities
* confrontation/talk it out = deposit in EBA
* opportunity to grow the relationship like Danny Tanner

## Habit 4: Think Win/Win

### Principles of Interpersonal Leadership
* whenever go from independence to interdependence, step into a leadership role
    - effective interpersonal leadership = think win/win

### 6 Paradigms of Human Interaction
1. Win/Win
    * cooperation not competition
    * compromise is a low form of win-win
2. Win/Lose (competition)
    * Most of Life teaches us Win/Lose (competition):
        - education - competition for grades, cooperation is cheating
        - sports - win/lose
        - law - suing in court
    * No need to compete with spouse, children, coworkers, neighbors, friends
3. Lose/Win (pushover)
    * worse than Win/Lose
        - no standards, expectations, vision
        - eager/quick to please, want acceptance
        - being a nice guy and giving up
    * buried feelings - never go away
        - causes illness: respiratory, circular
        - bad feelings: resentment, disappointment, disillusionment, rage/anger, cynicism
            * affects self-esteem and relationship with others
    * many people go between Win/Lose and Lose/Win - lack structure, direction, expectation, discipline
4. Lose/Lose
    * Two Win/Lose people (stubborn, egotistical) always a lose-lose
        - want to get revenge
    * philosophy of enemies, war, and misery loves company
5. Win
    * as long as you get what you want
6. Win/Win
7. No Deal (agree to disagree)

* Which is best depends on the situation. Most of the time you want cooperation in relationships (win-win)
* Negotiation - Win-Win or No Deal
    - try again later so no resentment
    - works best in beginning of relationship, not always realistic No Deal

### 5 Dimensions of Win-Win
1. Character
    * Integrity - Habits 1-3 develop/maintain
    * Maturity - balance of Courage and Consideration
        - "ability to express one's own feelings and convictions balanced with consideration for the thoughts and feelings of others"
        - Win/Win: Be nice, courageous, empathic, confident, considerate, sensitive, brave
        
|                        | Low Courage | High Courage |
| ---------------------- |:-----------:| :-----------:|
| **High Consideration** | Lose/Win    | Win/Win      |
| **Low Consideration**  | Lose/Lose   | Win/Lose     |

* Abundance Mentality - "There's plenty to go around"
    - people with scarcity mentality
        * don't like differences (insubordination/disloyalty), prefer yes-men
        * difficult to function as a team
    - deep sense of personal worth and security
    - share: prestige, recognition, profits, decision making
        * appreciates uniqueness, inner direction, proactiveness of others
    - public victory: working, communicating, making things happen together unable to do by themselves
2. Relationships
3. Agreements
4. Support Systems
5. Processes

### Relationships
* Trust (EBA) - basis of Win/Win
    - without trust the best result is compromise
    - lack credibility for open, mutual learning/communication, real creativity
    - if EBA trust is high, credibility is not an issue and respect is mutual
        * can focus on the issues/each other's point of view, not on personalities
* Dealing with a Win/Lose person
    - relationship is key (focus on circle influence) make EBA deposits by:
        * courteous, respect, appreciation for that person and their point of view
        * longer communication, more listening, more expressions of courage
        * not reactive, be proactive
    - stay strong, keep hammering it out until they realize you genuinely want a win/win
        * alternative is no deal or compromise
* Bad character traits:
    - reactive stance: say you support their decision, but don't really behind their back, and then say "oh it didn't work out"
    - overactive stance: try to sabotage the outcome of their decision that you disagree with
    - maliciously obedient: follow exactly as told, but take no responsibility for results

### Agreements
* Desired results - ID what needs to be done and when
* Guidelines - specify parameters/principles/policies
* Resources - ID human, financial, technical support available to help get results
* Accountability - sets standards for performance/evaluation
* Consequences - good/bad, natural/logical as a result of evaluation

### Processes
* Separate person from problem
    - focus on interests not positions
    - create options for mutual gain
    - insist on objective criteria
* 4 Steps to Win/Win:
    1. See problem from other point of view
        - give expressions to needs/concerns better than they can 
    2. ID the key issues involved
    3. Determine what results = fully acceptable solution
    4. ID new options to achieve those results
* Character of integrity, maturity, and abundance mentality [from high trust relationships]

## Habit 5: Seek to Understand, Then to be Understood (go last)
### 4 forms of communication
1. Reading
2. Writing
3. Speaking
4. Listening
* We learn 1-3 in school/life, but need to listen more
* must have good core conduct/character - others can sense duplicity and will distrust you by default

### Empathic Listening
* Most people listen with intent to reply instead of understanding
* 5 Listening Forms: Ignore, Pretend, Selective, Attentive (words only), Empathic (Feeling)
    - be a shrink
    - non-verbal: listen with ears, eyes, and heart
    - listen for feeling, behavior, and meaning
* rephrase content (logic) & describe/reflect how they feel (feeling) 
    - indulge them, don't judge/react
    - use when responses are emotional
    - if responses are logical then can ask questions/give advice
* info gathering

#### Example Conversation
Son: "Boy, Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds!"

Dad: "You're feeling really frustrated about school"

Son: "I sure am. It's totally impractical. I'm not getting a thing out of it."

Dad: "You feel like school's not doing you any good."

Son: "Well, yeah. I'm just not learning anything that's going to help me. I mean, look at Joe. 
He's dropped out of school and he's working on cars. He's making money. Now that's practical."

Dad: "You feel that Joe really has the right idea"

Son: "Well, I guess he does in a way. He's really making money now. But in a few years, I bet 
he'll probably be ticked off at himself."

Dad: "You think Joe's going to feel he made the wrong decision."

Son: "He's got to. Just look at what he's giving up. I mean, if you don't have an education, you can't make it in this world"

Dad: "Education is really important"

Son: "Oh, yeah! I mean, if you don't have a diploma, if you can't get jobs or go to college, what are you going to do? You've got to have an education."

Dad: "It's important to your future"

Son: "It is. And you know what? I'm really worried. Listen, you won't tell mom, will you?"

Dad: "You don't want your mother to find out"

Son: "Well, not really. You can tell her, she'll probably find out anyway"

### 4 Autobiographical Responses (Talk about Ourselves NOT GOOD)
1. Evaluate - Agree/Disagree
2. Probe - Ask objective questions
3. Advise - Give objective advice
4. Interpret - Explain their motives

### Then Seek to be Understood
* Ethos: personal credibility, how people perceive your integrity and competency. Your trust level (EBA)
* Pathos: emotional alignment, empathic/feeling with others 
* Logos: logic and reasoning

## Habit 6: Synergize
* Putting it all together, a little each day
* Sum is greater than it's parts, but individual is most important

### Communicate Synergistically
* open to new possibilities/alternatives - fulfilling Habit 2
* Requires personal security, openness, and sense of adventure
    - not sure what will happen, but it will be better than before
    - everyone can be genuine/authentic/inspired and express themselves freely because of trust and courage

### Level of Communication
* Synergistic (Win/Win): High Trust, High Cooperation
* Respectful (Compromise): Some Trust, Some Cooperation
* Defensive (Win/Lose or Lose/Win): Low Trust, Low Cooperation

### Negative Synergy
* Insecure people think others need to bend to their views
    - don't realize strength in relationship is having another point of view 
    - essence of synergy = value differences

### Value Differences
* Everyone sees the world differently not as it actually is
    - ex: old/young lady abstract picture
* both people can be right doesn't have to be either/or

## Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw
* Take time to focus on renewing yourself: Physically, Spiritually, Mentally, Socially/Emotionally
    - Best/Most Powerful investment is in yourself (Quad II/effective use of time)
* For Organizations: Economic (Phys), Treatment of People (Social), Training/Development (Mental), Service of job (Spirit)
